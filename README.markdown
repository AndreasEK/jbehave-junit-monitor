JBehave JUnit Integration
=========================

This little project is designed to make JBehave
stories & scenarios show up in the JUnit view
in Eclipse and potentially other IDEs that support
custom test runners.

Installation
==========================
The project consists of only a handful of classes
and is easy to use. 


Using Maven
-------------------
The easiest way is to include
it in your acceptance test project(s) by ways of
a Maven dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>
        <artifactId>jbehave-junit-runner</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

As this is still work in progress, there is no
pre-built version yet. Please download the source
and run `mvn install` on it. This will install
the compiled library into your local repository
and make it available to other projects you build.

Without Maven
---------------------
If you cannot or do not want to use Maven, just
compile the classes and package them into a JAR
file. Add that to your classpath.

Also make sure you add the dependencies of this
library to the classpath as well. They can be
seen in the `pom.xml`. For convenience, they are
listed here, too:

  * jbehave-core (3.6)
  * junit (4.10)
  * slf4j-api (1.6.4)


Usage
====================================
Once it is on your classpath, the runner can be used
to visualize the structure and the successes/failures
of your JBehave acceptance tests.

Enabling
-------------------------------
You will probably alread have one or more classes
that extend the default JBehave `JUnitStories` class.
Just add this annotation:

    @RunWith(JUnitReportingRunner.class)
    public class MyAcceptanceTests extends JUnitStories {
        ....
    }

Usually, this is everything you have to do.

Caveat
----------------------------
If you run into problems like this

    java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: MyAcceptanceTests.storyPaths()
        at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredMethod(Class.java:1937)
        at org.jbehave.scenario.finegrained.junit.monitoring.JUnitReportingRunner.<init>(JUnitReportingRunner.java:33)
        at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)
        at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:39)
        at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:27)
        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:513)
        at org.junit.internal.builders.AnnotatedBuilder.buildRunner(AnnotatedBuilder.java:31)
        ....
        
you are likely extending a custom base class which
was probably introduced to provide some common methods
for all  your test classes. This is perfectly fine,
however in case you pulled up the `storyPaths()` method
into that common base class, you

  1. either need to make it public _OR_
  1. override it in all your base classes 
     (just calling the super implementation is fine).
     
This is due to a reflection issue. This might be fixed in
future versions.


Example output
=================================
Once you are all set, you use the regular `Run As -> JUnit Test`
command in Eclipse. The JUnit view should appear and display something
like this:

Open Issues
=================================
`GivenStories` is not yet supported. If you use them in your
Stories, the output will not work correctly. The tests themselved
will not be affected, though.
